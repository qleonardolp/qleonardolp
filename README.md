Welcome to my GitHub home. I'm a mechatronic engineer, currently working at [Senai Cimatec](https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics). 
I'm also a member of the [Legged Robotics Group](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp), as a PhD candidate.

- 💬 Ask me about: control systems, impedance control, robotic physical interaction control, DSP, ros2_control
- 👁️‍🗨️ I'm looking forward to learning: Typescript
